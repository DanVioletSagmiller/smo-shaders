# SMO Shaders

## Overview
This repository contains a Unity project that emulates the shaders found in Super Mario Odyssey's Snapshot Mode. Inside the `Shaders` folder, there is a collection of template shader files, alongside a folder called `Complete` which contains finished and commented versions of all of those shader files. The reader is intended to follow the Image Effects tutorial series found on https://danielilett.com/, which outlines how each of the shaders work.

## Software
The project was created using Unity 2019.2.0a9, but it should be possible to upgrade or downgrade to other versions of Unity.

## Authors
These shaders, and the corresponding tutorial series, were written by [Daniel Ilett](https://github.com/daniel-ilett).

## Release
The shader collection was released on April 24th alongside the introduction of the tutorial series.

Thanks for reading my tutorials.
